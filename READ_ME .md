**This is the overall methodology diagram of the paper:**

Fig. 1. Overall framework diagram of SAC-EC.In this section, the system models are presented, in cluding the task load model, the MDC environment model, the combined energy consumption model, and the dynamic pricing strategy. In Figure 1, the orange block is the task load model, which is used for task allocation. The green block is the MDC environment model, which describes the environmental resources. The blue block is the joint energy consumption model, which represents the overall energy consumption of the MDCs.
